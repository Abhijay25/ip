# Use Cases of AI Assistance in Existing Code (As of Week 6)

# Quacker.java

### Time Saved: 30 mins
 - Used for adding logging at various stages of implementation
 - Ensuring code stability with try catch statements for file loading
 - Final check at return statement, ensuring returnedd value is non null


# FileClass.java

### Time Saved: 1 hour
 - Better error handling and logging for missing file errors
 - Increased efficiency for saving tasks (by using BuffereddWriter)
 - Better loading of files with auto closing by using 'try' statement


# Parser.java

### Time Saved: 3 hours
 - Cleaner return strings, DRY method implemented
 - Cleaning up unused string
 - Pointing out case sensitivity in command and storage issues
 - Helped correct an oversight, where all inputs would be stored in lowercase only
 - Handled errors in FileClass once Parser was refactored
